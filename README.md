Hi, Ahmed. I’m Jeremy, founder & CEO of pega6—higher ed built for hackers. We’re opening just 4 spots in our Fall ’26 cohort, and based on what you’ve done at Hack United, I think you might belong here.



Pega6 lets you launch your tech career 3 years earlier and $250,000 ahead of college students, and you graduate with an employment guarantee (or launch your own startup).



No lectures. No textbooks. No tests. Just a full year building real software, and you emerge as a coveted AI Product Builder.

Hackers don’t waste their time with college. You’ve got a world to conquer.

Hi Jeremy,

Thank you for reaching out, and for taking the time to review my work at Hack United. I appreciate the thoughtful message.

I’d love to better understand a few points before taking any next steps:

1. Could you clarify the structure and expectations of the pega6 program?

   - What is required from participants during the year?
   - Are there any financial commitments, revenue share, or long-term obligations involved?
   - How flexible is the program for founders who are already building large-scale projects?

2. I’m also curious whether my project submission, 7 Worlds, has progressed meaningfully within the Hack United evaluation process.

   - Has it reached an advanced review stage or shortlist?
   - Is there anything additional you’d recommend I prepare or share at this point?

Finally, I’d appreciate learning more about the key benefits of the program for builders focused on creating ambitious, long-term ventures rather than traditional employment paths.

Thank you again for the consideration. I look forward to your guidance.

Best regards,
Ahmed

Hi Jeremy,
Thank you for the link. I’ve reviewed the program details and the $15,000 tuition structure.
Given that I am already building 7 Worlds with complex AI and hologram integration, I am looking for a path that focuses on scaling my startup rather than a standard learning track.
Before I fill out the general application, I’d like to discuss if there are scholarship opportunities or founder-track incentives for participants with advanced projects like mine. I believe my work can add significant value to the Fall '26 cohort."
